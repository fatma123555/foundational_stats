# 📊 Foundational Statistics

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my work on **Foundational Statistics** as part of my **DS/MLE Master Plan**.  
It includes notebooks, datasets, and reports exploring descriptive and inferential statistics, with a focus on **building strong EDA skills** and applying statistical concepts in Python.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **data/** → Raw datasets (e.g., `tips.csv`)
- **descriptive statistics/** → Practice notebooks and feedback related to descriptive statistics
  - `descriptive_practice.ipynb` → Notebook with exercises and analysis
- **simple EDA/** → Applied EDA project
  - `eda_report.ipynb` → Full EDA notebook on the tips dataset

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Practice **summary statistics** (mean, median, IQR, range, standard deviation).
- Learn how to handle **categorical vs numerical data**.
- Apply **EDA techniques** with Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Document findings in a structured and professional way.

## 🛠️ Tools

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
