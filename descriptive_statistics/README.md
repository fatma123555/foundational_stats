# Simple EDA: Tips Dataset

## Goal

This project is part of my ongoing practice in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. The aim was to take a small, well-known dataset (`tips.csv`) and:

- Practice **data familiarisation** (checking structure, nulls, and column types).
- Explore **basic descriptive statistics** and **distributions**.
- Formulate **testable hypotheses** about tipping behavior.
- Document insights clearly in Markdown, combining **plots + commentary**.

## Why This Dataset

The `tips` dataset is simple, widely used in teaching, and contains both **categorical** and **numerical** variables. It allows for a focused EDA while still raising realistic business-style questions, such as:

- Do larger parties tend to tip more?
- Are tips different at lunch vs dinner?
- What is the distribution of tip percentages?

## Next Steps

- Extend the analysis to tip percentages (`tip รท total_bill`).
- Explore the influence of **smoker status**, **sex**, and **day of the week**.
- Move from descriptive exploration toward **statistical testing**.

This repo is not about building a predictive model but about building a **strong, structured workflow for EDA**, showing the thought process as well as the results.
