# 📝 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Tips Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs a **descriptive exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the popular **Tips dataset**, which records restaurant bills and tips, along with categorical details such as dining time, day of the week, smoker status, and party size.

The analysis is part of my structured **DS/MLE Master Plan** self-study (Month 1: Statistics Foundations & EDA), where the goal is to apply summary statistics and visualizations to develop practical analysis skills.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Perform **categorical analysis** of diners (e.g., sex, smoker, day, time, party size).
- Explore **numerical distributions** of bills and tips using histograms and boxplots.
- Identify **skewness, outliers, and imbalance** within the dataset.
- Develop **testable hypotheses** around tipping behavior:
  - Does **party size** influence tip amount?
  - Does **time of dining** (Lunch vs Dinner) affect tips?
  - How does **tip percentage** vary across groups?
